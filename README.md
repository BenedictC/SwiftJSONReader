# SwiftJSONReader

A port of some of the functionality of BCJSONReader to Swift. The most noticeable functionality is JSONPath. This is more proof of concept than finished code. It has no tests and has not been probably used in the wild. For a more stable Swift based JSON tool I recommend considering SwiftyJSON.
